Hello, and welcome to the offical Noctis website! is it a bit too fancy for a game org? possibly but who cares. We'll be posting updates and news on this sites as well as whatever else we think should belong on here.

## What are you making?
In terms of what we will be doing is well, pretty obvious , we are making games in S&box! Currently we are exploring ideas for a Stardew Valley inspired farming game but with our own take on it. The goal is for a cozy, enjoyable game with a addicting game loop. More details on that later.
